When using Git over SSH, authentication involves setting up SSH keys. Here's a basic overview of the process:

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair**: First, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine if you haven't already done so. You can generate a new SSH key pair using the `ssh-keygen` command:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

    This command will create a new SSH key pair using the RSA algorithm with a key length of 4096 bits. Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your email address.

2. **Store SSH Key**: By default, `ssh-keygen` creates the SSH key pair in the `~/.ssh` directory with the filenames `id_rsa` (private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (public key). 

3. **Add Public Key to Git Hosting Service**: Next, you need to add the contents of the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to your Git hosting service. This is typically done by copying the contents of the public key file and pasting it into the SSH key settings on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

4. **Authenticate Using SSH**: Now, when you interact with your Git repository using SSH, Git will use your SSH key for authentication instead of asking for a username and password. Make sure your remote URLs are using the SSH format. For example:

    ```bash
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repo.git
    ```

    Replace `user/repo.git` with the actual path to your repository.

5. **Test SSH Connection**: You can test if everything is set up correctly by running:

    ```bash
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

    Replace `github.com` with the hostname of your Git hosting service. You should receive a message confirming your connection.

6. **Optional: SSH Agent (for passphrase-protected keys)**: If you've added a passphrase to your SSH key for additional security, you can use an SSH agent to manage your keys. This allows you to enter the passphrase once per session rather than every time you interact with your Git repository. 

    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

    Replace `id_rsa` with the name of your private key file if it's different.

By following these steps, you can authenticate with Git using SSH keys, providing a more secure and convenient way to access your repositories.
